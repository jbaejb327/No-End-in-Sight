# No End in Sight
**Break the boundaries. Explore the infinite.**

No End in Sight removes Minecraft's world border and teleportation limits, allowing players to walk, fly, or teleport beyond the 30-million block edge — and ensures terrain continues to generate, no matter how far you go.

Whether you're chasing the elusive Far Lands, building megastructures in deep coordinates, or stress-testing procedural generation, this mod gives you true freedom.

# Features:
 * Removes the vanilla world border (±30,000,000 blocks)

 * Allows full teleportation beyond normal limits (via /tpfar)

 * Enables infinite terrain generation as you move

 * Survival-friendly — walk, build, and explore with no restrictions

 * Works in singleplayer and multiplayer

# Command:
/tpfar <x> <y> <z>
Teleport to any coordinates — no clamping or caps.

# How It Works:
On world load and player join, the mod automatically sets the world border to a tremendous value and disables position clamping, unlocking true endless travel. Chunk generation continues normally as long as you're moving.

# Compatibility:
Minecraft 1.20.x and up

Built with MCreator — lightweight, modpack-friendly
